#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='Iphone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in Febuary.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


#4. Which product was the cheapest product sold in January and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in(SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product; 


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
